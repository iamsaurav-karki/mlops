Welcome to my MLOps learning repository! This repo documents my progress, code snippets, and projects as I work through the **[Complete MLOps Bootcamp With 10 End to End ML Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-mlops-bootcamp-with-10-end-to-end-ml-projects)** on Udemy.

## 🎯 Goal
The goal of this repository is to transition from standard Machine Learning modeling to **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)**, mastering the deployment, monitoring, and automation of ML pipelines.
